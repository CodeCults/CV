# 🌐 Online CV – Personal Portfolio Website

### 🧠 Motivation

This project was born out of two core motivations:

1. I had just started learning artificial intelligence.
2. I wanted to study abroad, and building a flexible, expandable CV website felt like the perfect way to showcase my progress and capabilities.

Rather than a static résumé, this project is a living portfolio that I can evolve as I grow.
